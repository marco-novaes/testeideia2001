						<h3><a href="#">Paid Advertising on All Channels</a></h3>
			<p>To reach your potential buyers, <a href="#">you have to know who they are</a>, where they spend their time 
				online, and how they make their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are 
				able to identify your niche market, then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that 
				reach those interested in your property. These paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring 
				you are not spending money marketing to those who are not in the market for a property such as yours.

						<h3><a href="#">Expert Content Production</a></h3>
			<p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property. Being able to create 
				high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real 
				estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey, <a href="#">85 percent of buyers and sellers 
				want to work with an agent who uses video</a>—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with 
				potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, 
				they are showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is 
				much more difficult to do with a written description.
				However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described in appealing and 
				vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with 
				Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content 
				marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

						<h3><a href="#">Effective Search Engine Optimization</a></h3>
			<p>Recent research has shown that <a href="#">44% of buyers found the home they purchased</a> on the internet. Many of them 
				simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your 
				home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your 
				online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or SEO. 
				The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts 
				at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will
				show up in the results and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

					<h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
			<p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of niche 
				buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large 
				chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service 
				providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing 
				your property and let an expert handle their social media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated 
				success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in 
				their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to 
				advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.

						<h4>Immersive Property Experience</h4>
			<p>Every real estate agent’s success starts with their website. If an agent doesn’t have a responsive, 
				user-friendly website that is easy to navigate and provides an immersive experience for viewers who want 
				to look at properties, they’ve already lost their advantage. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence 
				have websites that are designed and managed by seasoned professionals who know what property buyers want. 
				Their sites are designed to impress with virtual tour integration, HD video capabilities, and lead capture 
				strategies that help agents sell your home. Agents are further supported by analytics reporting, 
				SEO optimization, third party integrations, and a reporting dashboard to help them easily utilize their 
				site and maximize its potential. An agent who is backed by a powerful website is one who can easily 
				reach a niche audience, streamline the selling process, and ensure your home gets the best promotion possible.
